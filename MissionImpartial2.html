  Welcome to Mission Impartial! I’m Akeelah Andrew, and I’m currently a business student living in the Caribbean.
  Advocating for social justice has been a passion of mine for a very long time now.
  I’ve decided to dedicate this project to mental health advocacy with a focus on the effects of oppression on the mental health of oppressed people.
  Over the past few years of being an activist I’ve learnt (and I’m still learning) so much related to this topic and others.
  I hope to share some of what I’ve learnt with you on this platform :)
