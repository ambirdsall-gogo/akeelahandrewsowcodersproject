         <h2 class="Heading"> About The Creator of Mission Impartial </h2>
   Welcome to Mission Impartial! I’m Akeelah Andrew, and I’m currently a business student living in the Caribbean.
   Advocating for social justice has been a passion of mine for a very long time now.
   I’ve decided to dedicate this project to mental health advocacy with a focus on the effects of oppression on the mental health of oppressed people.
   Over the past few years of being an activist I’ve learnt (and I’m still learning) so much related to this topic and others.
   I hope to share some of what I’ve learnt with you on this platform :)

    <div class="Introduction"> <h2 class="Heading"> The Effects of Oppression on the Mental Health of Oppressed People:</h2>

In the Caribbean, as well as many other places in the world mental illness and mental health has been stigmatised,
 inappropriately treated and ignored. This negative stigma or approach, has lead to the neglect of discussions about mental health and treatment
 for mental illness. In order to achieve social justice, it is necessary to evaluate the connections between mental illness, poverty and, being part of a
  marginalized/oppressed community etc. This platform contains information about these issues as well as free and affordable mental health care resources.

How does oppression lead to mental illness?
The experiences and adversities of all marginalized groups are different. However, studies have shown the effects of oppression on these groups are quite similar.
Facing discrimination, being bullied and being a victim of continuous hate crimes has the potential to lead to chronic anxiety, depression and other mental disorders.
According to NBC News, two out of five LGBTQ youth have seriously considered suicide in the past year. Results from a survey done by the <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/"> TheTrevorProject </a>
 has determined that 46% of
LGBTQ youth report they wanted psychological or emotional counselling from a mental health professional but were unable to receive it in the past 12 months.
According to <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/"> Medical News Today </a> A 2015 meta-analysis found that BIPOC(Black, Indigenous People of Colour) who reported experiences of racism also reported that they experience
 the following mental health issues:

 <br>

<li>Depression</li>
<li> Anxiety </li>
<li> PTSD(Post-traumatic stress disorder)</li>
<li> Suicidal thoughts </li>

           Unfortunately, mental health resources and information on how and where
           to receive treatment for mental illness is not easily accessible to everyone. One of the objectives of this project,
           is to create a platform containing the relevant resources and information necessary to seek treatment for mental illness
          and to learn more about the importance of mental health!
